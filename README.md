### CR-6 SE Hot end circuit board community edition

The CR-6 SE hot end circuit board community edition is a reverse engineered circuit board based on the Creality board. The intention behind it's release is to make the design opensource and encourage further development of the strain gauge bed levelling system and to allow alternate circuit boards for custom hot ends. This sub repository contains the following files:
* Circuit board schematics
* Circuit board layouts
* Datasheets of used components
* Production files for circuit board manufacturing
* Manual containing:
   * How to order the circuit board;
   * How to flash firmware on the circuit board;
   * How to install the circuit board;
   * How to test and calibrate the circuit board.
